Interactive environments and debugging
------------------------------------------

Ipython
++++++++
`IPython <https://ipython.org/>`_ (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in python, originally developed to make python easy and interactive, it offers introspection, rich media, shell syntax, tab completion, and history.

.. IPython is actually a python interpreter. It improves exploration, debugging, and optimization of the python code.

Jupyter
++++++++
`Jupyter Notebook <http://jupyter.org/>`_  is a open source application for writing and sharing code and text.
It is one of the popular data science tool in python.

It has replaced IPython notebook, which initially supported only python but now later started supporting many languages. IPython notebooks was started to make working with python easy and interactive. IPython provides python backend (also known as kernel) for Jupyter



pdb and ipdb
++++++++++++++

`pdb` is a debugging tool that is part of python's standard library. It is an interactive source code debugger for Python programs.

`ipdb` exports functions to access the IPython debugger, which features tab completion, syntax highlighting, better tracebacks, better introspection with the same interface as the `pdb` module.
