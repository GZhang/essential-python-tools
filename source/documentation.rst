Markdown (.md)
------------
`Markdown <https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>`_  is the most widely used markup language and it is often used to format readme files.

There are different versions of markdown used , and `github <https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/>`_ suggested one is the most popular.


Restructured Text (.rst)
---------------------

`reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ is an easy-to-read, plaintext markup syntax and parser system. 

When compared `reStructuredText` is more formalised and powerful than `markdown`.

It is useful for in-line program documentation (such as Python docstrings), for quickly creating simple web pages, and for standalone documents. 

reStructuredText is designed for extensibility for specific application domains.


When to use `markdown` and `reStructuredText`
=================================


+ If you want to write a gist or a single page readme then it is better to use `markdown`.
+ It you want to a write a documentation consisting of many in-line programs and tables then it is better to use `reStructuredText`.
